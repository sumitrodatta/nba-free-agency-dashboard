      Note: The Plotly graphs don't seem to load correctly while using the Safari browser, so I would strongly suggest
      to alternatively use Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox instead. In addition, I don't believe the web app is
      mobile-friendly (those updates are hopefully for next year!), so I would recommend navigating using desktop views.

      FAQ
   </h2>
   <ol>
      <li><b>How are the similarity scores calculated?</b></li>
      <p>The train set (2016-2021 free agent stats) and evaluation set (2022 free agent stats) were combined. The target variables were discarded. Each column was scaled to a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The Euclidean distance between every pair of rows was calculated. This is done by squaring the difference in each column's values between the rows, summing these squares and then taking the square root of this sum. A Euclidean distance of 0 means there is no difference in any column between the two rows, which would be the case when a row is compared to itself. The Euclidean distances were then rescaled between 0 and 1, where a higher distance corresponds to a lower similarity score and a zero distance corresponds to a 100% similarity score.</p>
      <li><b>What were the underlying stats you used as inputs to the models?</b></li>
      <p>
         I initially used player age, player experience (number of seasons played), contract-year box score per-game
         statistics as well as Offensive Win Shares, Defensive Win Shares, Value Over Replacement Player and Win Shares
         per 48 Minutes. There's anecdotal evidence that players exert more effort in their contract year. I also used
         box-score per-game statistics accumulated over the last 3 seasons, as players do get paid on past performance.
         3 years also allows me to keep the same model for restricted free agents.
      <ul>
         <li>My thought is that the rookie year is a bonus: great if you did well, but doesn't matter in the grand
            scheme of things if you did poorly.</li>
         <li>A rookie extension is more based on how the player improved over the course of that initial contract.</li>
         <li>For example, if Luka Dončić had a worse rookie year but had the same level of play that he has achieved in
            his second and third year (as well as next year), I highly doubt that Dallas would have offered him a
            significantly less amount of money due to that substandard rookie year</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
         In the first iteration of this project, games played and games started were scaled to a normal distribution due
         to fluctuations in games played between seasons caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I converted the games started
         to a percentage of games played and the games played to a percentage of maximum playable games. This maximum
         differed for players who played for multiple teams in one season.
      </p>
      <p>Finally, feedback on a previous iteration of this project alerted me to the concept of positional scarcity.
         Teams will overpay for the potential piece that puts them "over the hump", whether that be into playoff
         contention or the more loftier goal of championship contention. Teams might also panic to acquire a player that
         is deemed to be the last one in a talent tier above the remaining free agents in the same position. I bucketed
         players into 3 positions (guard, wing and big) based on their minutes played over the last 3 seasons, and I
         took their last-3-seasons VORP as a percent of their positional group's available VORP in that offseason. As an
         example from this year, Kyrie Irving was classified as a guard and accumulated 6.6 VORP over the last 3
         seasons. All other guards available in free agency accumulated a total of 33.9 VORP over the last 3 seasons, so
         Kyrie's percent of positional VORP comes out to 0.1946.</p>
      <li><b>How did you predict two targets at once?</b></li>
      <p>
         Since I was predicting two targets in the contract years and the first year percent of the salary cap which
         were highly correlated with each other, I decided to predict them in sequence. I ran models to predict one
         target without the other as a predictor, chose the best performing model (be that a single model or an ensemble
         of multiple models) and used the first target's predictions as an input to predict the second target. One
         potential problem is compounding errors. If there's an incorrect year prediction, it might lead to an incorrect
         salary prediction.
      </p>
      <li><b>What models did you test on?</b></li>
      <p>
         Predicting the first year percent of salary cap was a regression problem, while the contract years were seen as
         a classification problem. A 2.5-year contract doesn't make much sense, so it was in our best interest to
         discretize the years and store them as factors rather than round a regression result.
      </p>
      <p>
         I used a total of six models.
      <ul>
         <li>linear regression model as a baseline for salary, and multinomial regression as a baseline for years
            <ul>
               <li>the separation is due to the classification/regression split</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>k-nearest neighbors model: take the distance between the statistics of two players (the absolute value of
            the difference) and then take the average of the outcome variable of the k nearest neighbours
            <ul>
               <li>the intuition being that similar players get similar contracts</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>decision tree model (<i>rpart</i>): maybe as a player passes certain statistical thresholds, their contract
            increases
            <ul>
               <li>only using for predicting the contract years; since there are so many different salary percentages, a
                  solitary decision tree would either be useless or far too complicated</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>random forest model (<i>ranger</i>): reduces instability by averaging multiple trees
            <ul>
               <li>costs interpretability as there is no tree diagram that is representative of the decisions made</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>support vector machine model: attempt to separate classes with a hyperplane
            <ul>
               <li>support vectors are the points closest to the hyperplane, named as such because the hyperplane would
                  change if those points were removed</li>
               <li>I believe this <a
                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine#/media/File:Svm_separating_hyperplanes_(SVG).svg">image
                     from Wikipedia</a> succinctly explains an SVM</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <li><b>What models were part of the final predictions?</b></li>
      <p>In the years-first & salary-second model (Y1S2): a random forest is used as the years prediction, and the mean
         of a random forest & a support vector machine is used as the salary prediction.</p>
      <p>In the salary-first & years-second model (S1Y2): random forests are used for both components.</p>
      <li><b>How is the total contract value calculated?</b></li>
      <p>Contracts are usually reported in terms of total value, and players usually get five percent raises per year.
         We can use the formula for the future value of an annuity as an analog, where P is the first year percent of
         the salary cap multiplied by the salary cap, n is the number of contract years and r is 0.05 for the usual
         raise.</p>
         <p>FV=P &times; [<sup>(1+r)<sup>n</sup>-1</sup>] &frasl;<sub>r</sub></p>
